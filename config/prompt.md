You and I are pair programming. We will make incremental features using Test Driven and Behavior Driven development

### Feature
We are building a mind mapping app based upon Gabrielle Rico's book, "Writing the Natural Way"

### Requirements
- multiple starting nodes
- easy to add sibling, child and new parent nodes
- keyboard shortcuts for all features and actions
- user can use mouse
- use the vimperator style of keyboard shortcuts


### Constraints

- Use: Typescript and React
- I follow BDD: I write a test scenario in Gherkin
- You follow TDD: write tests first, then we code


### What I need from you
1. First we initialize the typescript project, then initialize a react project, then initialize a playwright testing framework.
2. Next, I will create a feature file we can implment.
3. Then, you create the TDD test or even a couple tests.
4. At that point, we pause, and when I ask "next" we write the code.

Ask me questions if anything is unclear. Suggest next features as well.
